                    <h4>A New Ensemble Learning Approach to Detect Malaria from
                        Microscopic Red Blood Cell Images
                    </h4>
                    <p class="description">Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease spread by infected female
                        Anopheles mosquitoes.
                        After analyzing it, microscopists detect this disease from the sample of microscopic red blood
                        cell
                        images. A professional microscopist is required to conduct the detection process, such an
                        analysis
                        may be time-consuming and provide low-quality results for large-scale diagnoses. This paper
                        develops an ensemble learning-based deep learning model to identify malaria parasites from red
                        blood cell images. VGG16(Retrained), VGG19(Retrained), and DenseNet201(Retrained) are
                        three models that are used in developing the adaptive weighted average ensemble models. To
                        reduce the dispersion of predictions, a max voting ensemble technique is then applied in
                        combination with adaptive weighted average ensemble models. A variety of image processing
                        techniques are utilized including the data augmentation technique to increase the number of data
                        and solve the overfitting problem of the model. Some other approaches of custom CNN, Transfer
                        Learning, and CNN-Machine Learning (ML) classifier techniques are also implemented for
                        comparing their performance with the ensemble learning model. The proposed ensemble learning
                        model provides the best performance among all with an accuracy of 97.92% to classify parasitized
                        and uninfected cells. Therefore, the deep learning model has the potential to diagnose malaria
                        more accurately and automatically.

                    <h4>Vehicle Speed Prediction based on Road Status using Machine Learning</h4>
                    <p class="description">The prediction of vehicle speed plays a significant role in energy
                        management. Predicting vehicle speed can help to designs a wide range of vehicle controllers,
                        especially in the case of an automated self-driving car for efficient fuel management
                        applications. Nowadays the issue of energy saving is becoming more popular. This paper has
                        proposed the prediction of the speed of the vehicle in different road statuses like in road
                        curvature, in traffic, in weather, and indifferent road conditions, etc. Data is collected from
                        different sources. This research is based on a supervised learning algorithm. Under supervised
                        learning, a linear regression algorithm has been used to train up the model. For implementation
                        Python programming language has been used. The proposed algorithm has provided better accuracy
                        and performance than the existing well knew state-of-arts algorithm.
